# Commonlit-Readability

## Things to try

- Check the impact of the seed 
- Choose one seed and check if using the best number of epochs gives the best results. Rerain on all the dataset.
- Check if stacking last hidden states of concat last hidden states with linear or conv1d head improves performance.
